Disagreement.AI: Business Plan & Strategic Roadmap (v5.0 FINAL)
Document Version: 5.0 Date: October 2, 2025

1.0 Executive Summary
Disagreement.AI is a chat-based resolution platform designed to help users resolve disputes through a conversational AI. Our core innovation is providing a simple, neutral, and cost-effective solution to conflict by allowing an AI to act as a mediator and fact-finder. Our immediate strategic focus is to dominate the untapped market of "micro-disputes"—low-value conflicts common on digital platforms that are currently abandoned. Our MVP strategy is to provide a free, exceptionally fast, and trustworthy tool to validate the product with an initial user base of "Founding Members." The primary goal is to prove the core concept and build a trusted brand.

2.0 Project Vision & Mission
Vision: To become the world's leading platform for accessible, AI-driven dispute resolution.
Mission: To provide a simple, impartial, and effective tool that empowers users to resolve conflicts fairly and efficiently, reducing the time, cost, and emotional burden of disagreements.

3.0 Core Product & Features (MVP)
The MVP will focus on delivering a streamlined, two-party dispute resolution experience. The core features include:
* **User Authentication:** Secure email/password registration and login.
* **Advanced Invitation Flow:** A secure, multi-channel system for inviting and approving participants.
* **Dashboard:** A simple interface for viewing active and resolved disagreements.
* **Chat Interface:** A real-time chat application for dispute resolution.
* **Default, Escalating AI Role:** The AI begins in a "Fact-Finder" mode and can be contextually escalated to a "Mediator" role, guiding users through a natural resolution process.
* **Downloadable & Emailed Resolution Summary:** Upon resolution, a PDF summary is automatically emailed to all participants and is available for secure download for 90 days. This provides a tangible asset for users.
* **Portable Reputation (Resolution Score):** A post-resolution feature where both parties can rate the process, allowing users to build a verifiable score of their fairness and reliability.

4.0 Market Analysis & Target Audience
Target Audience (Initial): Our primary focus is on the "micro-dispute" market.
* Digital Platform Users: Freelancers, clients on gig platforms, e-commerce buyers/sellers.
* Individuals in Shared Arrangements: Roommates, tenants, and landlords.
Target Audience (Long-Term): Online marketplaces, platforms, and corporations.

5.0 Development Roadmap & Technology
The full technical specifications are detailed in the "Disagreement.AI MVP: Definitive Strategic Development Plan (v9.0 FINAL)" document.

6.0 Monetization Strategy: A Phased Approach
Phase 1: Validation & User Growth (Single Free Plan)
* Goal: Achieve user adoption with a core group of "Founding Members."
* MVP Offering: A single, free "Founder's Plan" with generous access to all core features.

7.0 Marketing & Sales Strategy
Initial Launch (MVP):
* Product Hunt Launch: Target the early adopter and tech community.
* Community Engagement: Directly engage with users in relevant subreddits (e.g., r/Upwork, r/freelance).

7.1 "Founding Member" Program
Our initial user acquisition will be driven by a program that rewards early adopters with lifetime benefits, including a "Founder" badge, direct feedback channels, and priority access to new features.

8.0 Financial Projections

9.0 Ethical AI and Data Moat Strategy
Our competitive advantage is built on a foundation of user trust. This strategy is divided into two phases:
​Phase 1: Foundational Model Training (Pre-Launch)
The initial AI model will be trained without any real user data, using a combination of public, synthetic, and human-generated data to solve the "cold start" problem ethically.
​Phase 2: The "Data for Value" Exchange (Post-Launch)
To build our long-term, proprietary data moat, we will use a transparent, incentivized opt-in model where users receive a clear benefit in exchange for allowing us to train on an anonymized version of their case data. This ensures our data is ethically sourced.
​As part of our commitment to user privacy, we enforce a strict Data Deletion Policy: all sensitive dispute data is permanently deleted from our systems 120 days after a case is resolved.
​Implementation Plan: This will be implemented post-launch as a high-priority backend task. A scheduled "cron job" will run automatically on the server to find and permanently delete any resolved dispute data older than the 120-day limit.
