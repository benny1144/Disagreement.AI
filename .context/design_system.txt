Design System Name: "Apple-Inspired Trust & Clarity"

Mission Statement: To visually and textually guide users from a state of conflict to a state of resolution. Our tagline is "From Conflict to Clarity."

Core Principles:

De-escalation by Design: The UI must feel calm, clean, and in control to reduce user anxiety.

Trust & Transparency: Components and layouts should be clear, honest, and provide easy access to security and privacy information.

Minimalist Aesthetic: Every element should have a purpose. Avoid clutter.

Generous White Space: Use spacing to guide the eye and improve readability.

Clear Visual Hierarchy: The most important elements should be the most prominent.

Colors:

Primary Blue (Branding, Positive Actions, Links): #5D5FEF

Accent Green (Success States, Notifications): #28A745

Standard Text: #333333

Subtle Borders & Backgrounds: #E2E8F0 (gray.200)

Typography & Icons:

Font Family: Nunito

Icon Library: Heroicons

Layout Principles:

Bento Grids: For dashboards or complex information displays, use a grid layout to organize content into clean, scannable blocks.

Narrative Flow: On marketing pages, arrange sections to tell a story: Hero (What) -> Features (How) -> "Perfect For..." (Who).

Interaction Design:

Micro-interactions: All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) must have subtle, responsive feedback on hover and click (e.g., slight scale or color transition).

Motion Design: Use purposeful, non-intrusive animations (e.g., scroll-triggered entrances) to guide the user and explain processes, especially on the marketing site.

Component Patterns & Styling:

Buttons (Chakra UI): rounded="lg". Primary CTAs must use colorScheme="blue".

Buttons (Tailwind CSS): Pill-shaped (rounded-full). Primary CTAs must be high-contrast using the primary blue background.

Cards/Containers: rounded="xl" with a subtle boxShadow="md" to lift them off the page.

Footers: The marketing site footer must be comprehensive (legal, contact, mission). The in-app footer should be minimal but always contain links to Privacy and Terms.

Testimonials: This pattern must include a user's avatar/photo, their quote, and their name/title to maximize social proof.

Brand & UX Rules:

Stylized Brand Name: In "Disagreement.AI," the word "agreement" MUST be styled in Primary Blue.

Linguistic Reinforcement: Positive, resolution-oriented action words ("Agree," "Agreement") MUST be styled in Primary Blue.
1.  **Choice Words:** The words "Agree" and "Agreement," when used for positive actions, must always be styled in the Primary Blue color (#5D5FEF).
2.  **Stylized Brand Name:** In the brand name "Disagreement.AI" or "Disagreement," the word "agreement" MUST be styled in Primary Blue (#5D5FEF). The "Dis" prefix and ".AI" suffix MUST be the Standard Text color (#333333).


Chat Interface ("iMessage" Pattern):

User's own messages: Right-aligned, blue background, white text.
Other participants' messages: Left-aligned, gray background, black text.
