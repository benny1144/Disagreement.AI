# Specification: .nvmrc Node.js Version Fix (v2)
- **ID:** `spec.md.nvmrc_fix_v2`
- **Version:** 2.0
- **Date:** October 9, 2025
- **Author:** Gemini, Project Architect

## 1.0 Document Purpose
This document specifies the second and final revision to the `.nvmrc` configuration file. This change is required to meet the specific version requirements of the Vite build tool.

## 2.0 Problem Analysis
- **Symptom:** The Vite build is still failing, now with a more specific error: `Vite requires Node.js version 20.19+ or 22.12+`.
- **Root Cause:** The Node.js version specified in `.nvmrc` (20.11.1) is still too low for the project's dependencies.

## 3.0 Technical Requirement
The `.nvmrc` file must be updated to a specific version that satisfies the `20.19+` requirement.

### 3.1 Configuration Change
- **File:** `.nvmrc` (in the project root)
- **Action:** Replace the entire contents of the file.
- **New Value:** `20.19.1`

## 4.0 Verification Criteria
- After this change is committed and pushed, the next deployment on Render must succeed without any Node.js version errors.
