- **ID:** `spec.md.login_button_fix`

- **Author:** Gemini, Project Architect

## 1.0 Document Purpose
This document specifies the diagnostic steps and implementation required to fix the non-functional login button on the `LoginPage.tsx` component.

## 2.0 Problem Analysis
- **Symptom:** Clicking the login button produces no visual change, no network request, and no console errors.
- **Root Cause:** The `onClick` event handler on the button is likely not implemented, not correctly bound, or the function it calls is empty or failing silently.

## 3.0 Technical Requirement
The `LoginPage.tsx` component must be modified to:
1.  Ensure the form's `onSubmit` event is correctly handled.
2.  Implement a function (`handleLogin`) that is called upon form submission.
3.  Add `console.log` statements to provide explicit feedback in the browser's developer console during the login attempt.
4.  Call the `authService.login` method with the user's credentials.

## 4.0 Verification Criteria
- When the login button is clicked, a "Login attempt..." message must appear in the browser's developer console.
- After a successful login, a "Login successful!" message should appear in the console.
- The user should be redirected to the `/dashboard` page upon successful login.
