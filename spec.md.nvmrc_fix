# Specification: .nvmrc Node.js Version Fix
- **ID:** `spec.md.nvmrc_fix`
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Date:** October 9, 2025
- **Author:** Gemini, Project Architect

## 1.0 Document Purpose
This document specifies the necessary code change to resolve the deployment failure by updating the Node.js version specified in the project's `.nvmrc` configuration file. This supersedes the previous instruction to change a UI setting.

## 2.0 Problem Analysis
- **Symptom:** The Vite build fails due to an incompatible Node.js version (v18).
- **Root Cause:** The project's root directory contains a `.nvmrc` file with the value `18`, which forces the Render deployment environment to use an outdated and incompatible Node.js version.

## 3.0 Technical Requirement
The `.nvmrc` file in the project's root directory must be modified to specify a modern, compatible Long-Term Support (LTS) version of Node.js.

### 3.1 Configuration Change
- **File:** `.nvmrc` (in the project root)
- **Action:** Replace the entire contents of the file.
- **New Value:** `20.11.1`

## 4.0 Verification Criteria
- After this change is committed and pushed, the next deployment on Render must succeed.
- The build log must show that it is using the newly specified Node.js version (e.g., `Using Node.js version 20.11.1 via...`).
