# Specification: Deployment Build Fix
- **ID:** `spec.md.deployment_fix`
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Date:** October 9, 2025
- **Author:** Gemini, Project Architect

## 1.0 Document Purpose
This document specifies the necessary configuration change to resolve the deployment failure on the Render platform. The failure is caused by a mismatch between the build output directory and the publish directory expected by the deployment service.

## 2.0 Problem Analysis
- **Symptom:** The Render build log reports the error `==> Publish directory dist does not exist!`.
- **Root Cause:** The Vite build process is configured to output files to a directory named `out` (as seen in log entries like `../out/index.html`), while Render's "Publish Directory" setting is correctly set to the default, `dist`.

## 3.0 Technical Requirement
The `vite.config.js` file in the `client` directory must be modified to explicitly set the build output directory to `dist`.

### 3.1 Configuration Change
- **File:** `client/vite.config.js`
- **Option:** `build.outDir`
- **Value:** `'dist'`

## 4.0 Verification Criteria
- After this change is committed and pushed, the next deployment on Render must succeed.
- The build log should show the output files being created in the `dist/` directory (e.g., `dist/index.html`).
