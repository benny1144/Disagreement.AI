## Specification for Marketing Homepage (v5.0 FINAL)
This is the new, definitive blueprint for index.html, incorporating the expert analysis and strategic recommendations.

1.0 Objective
Create a high-trust, high-conversion, single-page marketing site using HTML and Tailwind CSS. The design must be clean, modern, and memorable, functioning as a persuasive journey that guides a visitor from uncertainty to action. It must strictly adhere to the project's official design system (

design_system.txt).

2.0 Structure
The page must have the following sections, designed to create a narrative flow:


Sticky Header: A minimalist header containing the logo and primary CTA button that appears on scroll.




Hero Section: Features the headline and an outcome-focused sub-headline, a placeholder for the 90-second animated explainer video, and the primary CTA button. A subtle "As Featured In" logo bar will sit directly below this section.






Features Section (Benefit-Driven): A three-column layout where each column highlights a key user benefit, not just a product feature.



"How It Works" Section (NEW): A simple, visually-driven 3-step process that demystifies the AI mediation process, ideally using scroll-triggered animations.






"Perfect For..." Section: A dynamic grid layout (e.g., a "bento grid") showcasing target user groups, with each use case reinforced by a specific, quoted testimonial.





Social Proof & Authority Section (NEW): A multi-faceted section featuring a prominent "hero" testimonial with a photo, a logo wall of partners or media mentions, and quantifiable data points (e.g., "92% satisfaction rate").






Final CTA Section: A final, prominent call-to-action before the footer.


Expanded Footer: A comprehensive footer to reinforce trust and professionalism.


3.0 Content

Headline: "Resolve Disputes, Not Relationships."


Sub-headline (Outcome-Focused): "Get an impartial AI mediator to guide you and your counterpart to a fair solution in minutes. Stop the back-and-forth, avoid expensive fees, and start moving forward."

Benefit 3: Title: "Resolve on Your Schedule" , Description: "No need to coordinate schedules or pay for expensive hourly appointments. Your AI mediator is ready 24/7, so you can solve issues the moment they arise."


"How It Works" Section Content:

Step 1: Title: "State Your Case." Description: "Privately and confidentially, you each describe your side of the disagreement in our secure chat."

Step 2: Title: "AI Finds a Path Forward." Description: "Our neutral AI analyzes the key points, identifies areas of common ground, and proposes several fair, evidence-based solutions."

Step 3: Title: "Reach a Formal Agreement." Description: "Review the proposed resolutions together and formally agree to the one that works for both of you. A secure, time-stamped record is saved for your reference."

Button Text (CTA): All call-to-action buttons must say: "Be the first to use it. Join the Founding Member waitlist".
