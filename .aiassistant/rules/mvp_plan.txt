Disagreement.AI: Tier 1 Implementation Blueprint (v1.1)
I. Purpose & Scope
This document provides the detailed technical specifications and product requirements for the features defined in Tier 1 of the Business Plan (v8.1). It is the single source of truth for the development team and the AI Implementer (Junie) for building the Core Foundation of the Disagreement.AI platform. Its purpose is to guide the execution of the initial product version, which will be launched to a select group of "Founding Members" for feedback.
Project Vision: A chat-based resolution platform where a conversational AI facilitates and mediates disputes.
Guiding Principles: Simplicity, User Trust, Performance, and Scalability.
II. Required Pages & User Experience (Tier 1)
Public-Facing Pages: Homepage, Legal (Privacy, Terms, Contact), Support (FAQ).
Application Pages: Authentication, Onboarding, Dashboard (Bento Grid), Chat Page, User Account.
III. Core Tier 1 Features
User Authentication: Secure email/password registration and login.
Invitation System ("Creator Approval Gate"): A system for adding participants to a dispute that requires the original creator's approval before they can join.
Two-Party Chat: A real-time chat interface for two participants and the AI mediator.
Base AI Mediator Agent: The core conversational AI, built with CrewAI, that guides the resolution process.
Final Agreement & Case Closure: A feature allowing users to formally agree on a resolution, which archives the case.
Email Notifications: Automated email workflows, managed by n8n, for all critical user actions.
IV. Tier 2 Foundation
To ensure a seamless transition to our competition-winning feature set, the following foundational elements must be built into the Tier 1 architecture:
Chat Page: The chat interface must be built with a placeholder component for the future "AI Decision Log" feature to ensure seamless integration in Tier 2.
Document Upload: The backend architecture for document storage must be designed with the "Agreement Analyzer" specifications in mind, including metadata tagging for future NLP analysis.
V. Technology Stack & Architecture
Frontend: React / Next.js.
Backend: Node.js (Express.js).
Database: MongoDB.
AI Service: Python (FastAPI) & CrewAI.
Workflow Automation: n8n.
Deployment: Render.
Architectural Model: The platform will use a microservices model where the main Node.js API communicates with a specialized Python AI Service.
VI. Data, Privacy & Brand Identity
Data Deletion Mandate: All sensitive dispute data is to be permanently deleted from the database 120 days after case resolution.
AI Training Protocol (Tier 1): The initial AI model will be trained exclusively on synthetic data.
Official Logo: "Disagreement.AI" in Inter Extra Bold. "agreement" is in Primary Blue.
Primary Color: #2667FF.
VII. Development Workflow & Styling
Official Design & Implementation Workflow: A strict "Visual Reference & Agent Workflow" will be followed, moving from ideation in Relume/Uizard to AI-powered implementation and developer-led logic integration.
Specific Component Styling Rules:
Chat Interface ("iMessage" Pattern): User messages are right-aligned (blue), opponent messages are left-aligned (gray), and AI messages are left-aligned with a distinct icon and background (#F3F4FF).
VIII. Post-Launch Feedback Framework (Tier 1)
Immediately following the Tier 1 launch, a structured process for capturing and acting on feedback from our "Founding Members" will be activated, managed via a three-tab Google Sheet (Framework, Repository, Roadmap).
IX. Internal AI Operations & Tooling
This section documents the architecture of the internal AI assistant ("Cognito" or "Project Brain"), which is a core part of the development infrastructure.
Platform: AnythingLLM (Docker Edition)
Core Chat LLM: Ollama - llama3:8b (Local, Private)
Agent LLM: Groq - llama3.3-70b-versatile (Cloud, for specialized tasks)
Vector Database: LanceDB (Local, Private)
Embedding Model: nomic-embed-text-v1
Core Principle: The system is architected for maximum privacy and accuracy, using a local-first model for knowledge retrieval and a powerful cloud model for agentic tasks requiring external access.
