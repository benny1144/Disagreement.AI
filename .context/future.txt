## Disagreement.AI: Future Platform Enhancements & Strategic Directions (v7.0 FINAL)
Document Purpose: This document outlines the strategic vision for Disagreement.AI beyond the initial MVP launch. It serves as a living repository of ideas for future development.
Immediate Post-Launch Priority: User Feedback & Iteration Framework
Purpose: To establish a systematic process for collecting, analyzing, and acting upon user feedback in the first 90 days post-launch.
Pillar 1: Core Product Evolution
The "Resolution Playbook": An interactive, data-driven feature providing users with AI-powered insights based on aggregated data from similar past cases.
Go-to-Market Note (NEW): When this feature is introduced to existing users, we will use an engaging "scrollytelling" modal that visually explains its benefits, reusing the animation style from the "How It Works" section of the homepage.
Resolution Verification & Smart Contracts: Integrate with payment platforms to facilitate and verify financial settlements.
Premium Community Forum: A low-cost way to test the value of a community for premium members.
Pillar 2: Advanced AI Capabilities
Proactive Dispute Prevention (The "Agreement Analyzer"): A tool for users to upload contracts for AI analysis to flag potential sources of future conflict.
Implementation Note (NEW): To accelerate development, the UI for this feature will repurpose components from the "Create New Disagreement" flow (e.g., the modal structure, buttons, and form elements), ensuring a consistent user experience.
AI-Powered Role Management: A suite of features including user-initiated role "flipping" and AI-recommended role pivots.
Pillar 3: Strategic Market Pivots
Vertical-Specific AI Mediators: Develop specialized AI models for high-value verticals like Freelancer-Client, Landlord-Tenant, B2B Workplace/HR, and Sports Team Cohesion.
Pillar 4: Geographic Expansion
Phase 1: USA-First Launch (Current Plan).
Phase 2: Worldwide Expansion (Post-MVP), targeting Spanish-speaking regions, Brazil, and India.
