Disagreement.AI: Business Plan & Strategic Roadmap (v8.0 - Competition Edition)
Document Version: 8.0
Date: October 10, 2025
Status: FINAL. This document is the single source of truth, superseding all previous versions. It reflects our strategic pivot to win the AI.gov Presidential Challenge.
1.0 Executive Summary
Disagreement.AI is a chat-based platform that utilizes a conversational AI to mediate and resolve disputes. Our mission is to provide an impartial, efficient, and accessible alternative to traditional conflict resolution methods.
Our immediate and primary objective is to build a best-in-class product to win the AI.gov Presidential Challenge. This supersedes all previous launch plans. Our strategy is centered on a Tiered Development Framework, designed to build a feature-complete, ethically transparent, and technologically superior platform by the competition deadline of January 13th, 2026.
An MVP will be launched as a milestone along this path to a select group of "Founding Members" for crucial feedback. The platform will be free for all users with unlimited features until February 1st, 2026, at which point a pre-developed, usage-based pricing model will be activated to begin commercialization.

2.0 Vision & Market Opportunity
Vision: To become the world's most trusted platform for AI-driven dispute resolution.
Mission: To democratize conflict resolution by providing a simple, fair, and effective tool that empowers users to find clarity and agreement.
Market Opportunity: The current Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) market is dominated by platforms that merely facilitate human mediation. We are positioned to disrupt this market by automating the core function of resolution itself, creating a new category of "AI-native" resolution. Our initial focus is the untapped market of "micro-disputes"—low-value conflicts common in digital commerce that are currently abandoned due to a lack of viable solutions.

3.0 The Tiered Development Framework
Our development is structured into three sequential tiers, ensuring a direct and focused path to our competition goal.
3.1 Tier 1: The Core Foundation (MVP Candidate)
Objective: To build a stable, secure, and functional platform that delivers the core value proposition. The completion of this tier triggers the MVP launch.
Key Features:
Secure User Authentication: Email/password and social logins.
Case Management Dashboard: An intuitive "Bento Grid" interface.
Advanced Invitation & Approval System: A secure "Creator Approval Gate" for adding participants.
Core Chat Interface: A minimalist UI built on the principle of "De-escalation by Design."
Base Conversational AI Mediator: A functional AI that guides the resolution process.
Final Agreement Generation & Export: Creating a final, downloadable PDF report.
Accessibility Compliance (WCAG): A foundational commitment to accessibility for all users.
3.2 Tier 2: The Competition Winner (The Differentiator)
Objective: To develop the innovative, trust-building, and proprietary AI features that will differentiate us and form the core of our competition entry.
Key Features:
The "Glass Box" Principle: Full implementation of an AI Decision Log & Audit Trail to provide radical transparency into the AI's reasoning.
Explainable AI (XAI): User-facing, plain-language explanations for AI recommendations.
Proactive Conflict Prevention ("The Agreement Analyzer"): A tool to analyze documents for potential conflict points before they arise.
The Resolution Playbook (v1): Data-driven strategic insights based on aggregated, anonymized data from similar past cases.
Vertical-Specific AI Model (Proof of Concept): Disagreement.AI Team Harmonizer. We will develop and train our first specialized model for Sports Teams. This strategic choice leverages the operator's industry connections to create a powerful, real-world case study for the competition judges.
B2B Preventative Analytics Dashboard (v1): A functional dashboard for our first business clients.
3.3 Tier 3: The Commercial Engine (Post-Competition Scale)
Objective: To build features required for broad market adoption, enterprise sales, and long-term commercial success after the competition.
Key Features:
Full Suite of Vertical-Specific AI Models: Expansion into high-value verticals like Landlord-Tenant, Freelancer-Client, and B2B Workplace/HR.
Resolution Verification & Payment Integration: Direct integration with Stripe and PayPal to automate financial settlements.
AI-Powered Debate Platform: A new product vertical for structured, moderated debates.
Enterprise Suite: API access and integrations with platforms like Slack and Microsoft Teams.

4.0 Go-to-Market & Branding
Brand Voice: Calm, Confident, Neutral.
Core Messaging: Emphasize providing users with leverage, speed, and fairness.
Official Brand Identity:
Logo: "Disagreement.AI" in Inter Extra Bold. The word "agreement" is styled in Primary Blue.
Primary Blue: #2667FF.

5.0 Governance & Ethical Commitments
Data Deletion Policy: All sensitive user data related to a dispute will be permanently and automatically deleted 120 days after case resolution. This is a non-negotiable pillar of our commitment to user privacy.
Ethical AI Training: Our AI models will not be trained on scraped or copyrighted data, mitigating the "ROSS Risk" and turning our ethical data sourcing into a key competitive advantage. Model improvements will be based on a transparent, opt-in "Data for Value" exchange.
Post-Launch Priority: Immediately following the MVP launch, we will activate a structured framework for capturing and acting on feedback from our "Founding Members" to accelerate our progress toward the competition-winning product.
