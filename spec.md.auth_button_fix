# Specification: Authentication Button Functionality Fix
- **ID:** `spec.md.auth_button_fix`
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Date:** October 9, 2025
- **Author:** Gemini, Project Architect

## 1.0 Document Purpose
This document specifies the required code changes to make the buttons on the `LoginPage.tsx` and `SignUpPage.tsx` components fully functional.

## 2.0 Problem Analysis
- **Symptom:** Clicking the "Log In" or "Sign Up" buttons has no effect. There are no console errors or network activities.
- **Root Cause:** The form elements on both pages lack state management for input fields and `onSubmit` event handlers to trigger an action.

## 3.0 Technical Requirements
Both `LoginPage.tsx` and `SignUpPage.tsx` must be updated to include:
1.  **State Management:** Use the `useState` hook to manage the values of the email and password input fields.
2.  **Event Handlers:** Implement `handleLogin` and `handleSignUp` functions to manage the form submission logic.
3.  **Form Submission:** Attach the event handlers to the respective form's `onSubmit` event.
4.  **Diagnostics:** Add `console.log` statements within the handlers to provide clear feedback in the browser's developer console.
5.  **Redirection:** Use the `useNavigate` hook to redirect the user to the `/dashboard` upon a successful action.

## 4.0 Verification Criteria
- Clicking the "Log In" button must log an attempt to the console and redirect to `/dashboard`.
- Clicking the "Sign Up" button must log an attempt to the console and redirect to `/dashboard`.
