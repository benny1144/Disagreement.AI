### 4.1 Homepage (`index.html`) Blueprint
The homepage follows a narrative flow designed to maximize user understanding and conversion. It will be constructed using the following components in this precise order:

1.  **Global Navbar**
2.  **Hero Section:** Captures attention with the core value proposition ("From Conflict to Clarity") and a primary "Get Started for Free" CTA.
3.  **Explainer Video Section:** A clean, focused section featuring the 90-second animated explainer video as its centerpiece. This is our primary educational tool.
4.  **How It Works Section:** A simple 3-step visual graphic explaining the process: 1. State Your Case, 2. AI Mediates, 3. Reach Agreement.
5.  **"Perfect For" (Use Cases) Section:** Displays the platform's versatility using a modern, tag-based UI to list target audiences (e.g., Freelancers, Landlords, Sports Teams / High-Performance Teams). Headline: "Designed for Any Disagreement."
6.  **Features Section:** A brief overview of key product features that support the value proposition (e.g., "Neutral AI Mediator," "Secure & Confidential," "Final Agreement Reports").
7.  **Final CTA Section:** A large, clear, final call-to-action to encourage sign-ups before the footer. Headline: "Ready to find your resolution?"
8.  **Global Footer**

### 4.2 Standard Content Pages (Privacy, Terms, FAQ)
These pages will use a simpler, document-style layout for readability.

1.  **Global Navbar**
2.  **Page Header:** A clean container with the page title (`h1`).
3.  **Content Body:** A single-column, max-width container for text, subheadings, and lists.
4.  **Global Footer**
