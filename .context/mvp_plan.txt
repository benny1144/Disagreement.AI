Disagreement.AI MVP: Definitive Strategic Development Plan (v12.0 FINAL)-----

I. Guiding Principles & Vision
Project Vision: A chat-based resolution platform where a conversational AI facilitates and mediates disputes.
Guiding Principles: Simplicity, User Trust, Performance, Risk Mitigation, Scalability.

II. Core Pages & User Experience (MVP)
Public Pages:
Homepage: A clean landing page featuring a 90-second animated explainer video, a clear value proposition, and a prominent call-to-action to sign up.
Application Pages:
Authentication: Register and Login pages.
In-App Onboarding: A simple, one-time flow for new users that explains the 3-step resolution process (State Your Case, AI Analyzes, Reach Agreement).
Dashboard: The user's home base. The layout will be a clean, scannable "Bento Grid" to organize active disagreements, resolved cases, and key actions.
It must feature a well-designed empty state if no disagreements exist.
Chat Page: The core interface. The design must be minimalist and calm, following a "de-escalation by design" principle.
It must include a persistent, non-intrusive legal disclaimer: "Please note: The AI does not provide legally binding advice."
User Account: Profile and Settings pages.

III. Core MVP Features
User Authentication: Secure email/password registration and login.
Invitation System & Creator Approval Gate: A system for adding participants to a disagreement, governed by the following rules:
If User A (the creator) directly invites one or more users via email, those users are auto-approved.
If a user tries to join via a general invite link, User A must approve them.
If User B (a participant) invites User C, User A must approve User C. The UI will state, "User B has nominated User C to join this disagreement."
Dashboard: View active and resolved disagreements.
Chat Interface: Real-time, two-party dispute resolution chat.
AI Roles: Users can select an AI persona (Mediator, Fact-Finder, Judge & Jury).
AI Resolution Report: AI-generated summary of the dispute.

IV. Technical Stack
IDE: IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate
AI/Automation: CrewAI, n8n
Frontend: React (Vite), Chakra UI
Backend: Node.js (Express), MongoDB, Socket.IO, Resend
Marketing Site: v0.dev, Tailwind CSS
Infrastructure: Render, Cloudflare Pages

VI. Core User Experience Principles
De-escalation by Design: The entire in-app user interface must feel calm, clean, and in control.
Use generous whitespace, a clear visual hierarchy, and a minimalist aesthetic.
Trust Architecture: Every screen must be engineered to build user trust.
Include persistent links to legal/privacy pages, clear language, and strategic social proof. This is our primary design directive.
All user-facing components, from the marketing homepage to the in-app chat, MUST adhere to the principles outlined in our 'Homepage Enhancement for Disagreement.AI' document, which serves as the project's official Trust Architecture guide.
Modern Engagement: Use subtle micro-interactions (e.g., button animations) to make the app feel responsive and polished.

VI-A. Official Design & Implementation Workflow
To ensure maximum velocity and a seamless transition from concept to code, this project will adhere to a strict "Visual Reference & Agent Workflow."
This developer-led process prioritizes in-IDE iteration over traditional design handoffs.
Phase 1: Rapid Visual Ideation
Structure (Relume): The layout and information architecture for any new page or component will be generated using Relume's AI wireframing tool.
Aesthetics (Uizard): The resulting wireframe will be imported into Uizard to apply our brand's visual style, generating a static mockup.
Deliverable: The final output of this phase is a single PNG image that serves as the visual source of truth for development.
Phase 2: AI-Powered Implementation (In-IDE)
All frontend development will be executed within the IDE, guided by the JetBrains AI Implementer.
The AI will be prompted to build the React component by referencing two sources: the feature's spec.md for functionality and the PNG mockup for all layout, styling, and visual structure.
Phase 3: Logic and Oversight
The developer's primary focus will be on reviewing the AI-generated UI code, implementing the necessary business logic, and ensuring all accessibility and performance standards are met.

VII. Specific Component Styling Rules
Chat Interface ("iMessage" Pattern):
User's own messages: Right-aligned, Primary Blue background, white text.
Other participants' messages: Left-aligned, gray background, black text.
AI messages: Left-aligned, with a distinct AI avatar/icon and a unique, subtle background color (#F3F4FF).

VIII. Post-Launch Strategy (Formalized)
User Feedback & Iteration Framework: Immediately following launch, we will implement a structured process for capturing and acting on user feedback.
This will be managed via a three-tab Google Sheet:
Framework: Defines the process for collecting, categorizing, and prioritizing feedback.
Repository: A master list of all incoming feedback from all channels.
Roadmap: A prioritized list of features and fixes to be developed, derived from the repository.
