Disagreement.AI MVP: Definitive Strategic Development Plan (v14.0 FINAL)
I. Guiding Principles & Vision
Project Vision: A chat-based resolution platform where a conversational AI facilitates and mediates disputes.
Guiding Principles: Simplicity, User Trust, Performance, Risk Mitigation, Scalability.
II. Core Pages & User Experience (MVP)
Public Pages:
Homepage: A clean landing page featuring a 90-second animated explainer video, a clear value proposition, and a prominent call-to-action to sign up.

FAQ
Application Pages:
Authentication: Register and Login pages.
In-App Onboarding: A simple, one-time flow for new users that explains the 3-step resolution process (State Your Case, AI Analyzes, Reach Agreement).
Dashboard: The user's home base. The layout will be a clean, scannable "Bento Grid" to organize active disagreements, resolved cases, and key actions. It must feature a well-designed empty state if no disagreements exist.
Chat Page: The core interface. The design must be minimalist and calm, following a "de-escalation by design" principle. It must include a persistent, non-intrusive legal disclaimer: "Please note: The AI does not provide legally binding advice."
User Account: Profile and Settings pages.
III. Core MVP Features
User Authentication: Secure email/password registration and login.
Invitation System & Creator Approval Gate: A system for adding participants to a disagreement that requires the original creator's approval before they can join.
Two-Party Chat: A real-time chat interface for two participants and the AI mediator.
AI Mediator Agent (CrewAI): The core conversational AI that guides the resolution process.
Final Agreement & Case Closure: A feature that allows users to formally agree on a resolution, which then closes the case and archives the chat.
Email Notifications (n8n): Automated email workflows for all critical user actions (registration, invitations, approvals, etc.).
IV. Technology Stack (Confirmed)
Frontend: React / Next.js
Backend: Python (FastAPI)
Database: PostgreSQL
Deployment: Render
AI Agent Framework: CrewAI
Workflow Automation: n8n
V. Data & Privacy (Mandatory)
Data Deletion: All sensitive dispute data is permanently deleted from the database 120 days after a case is resolved.
AI Training: The MVP AI model will be trained exclusively on synthetic data. No user data will be used for training to ensure maximum privacy and trust.
VI. Official Brand Identity
Logo: The official logo is the text "Disagreement.AI" in the Inter font (Extra Bold). In any instance of the word Disagreement, the word agreement must be Primary Blue, while Dis and .AI must be the standard text color.
Primary Color: #2667FF
VII. Official Design & Implementation Workflow This project will follow a strict, developer-led "Visual Reference & Agent Workflow".
Phase 1 (Ideation): Layouts are generated with Relume, and static mockups are created in Uizard. The deliverable is a single PNG image.
Phase 2 (AI-Powered Implementation): The JetBrains AI Implementer will build the React component by referencing the feature's spec.md and the PNG mockup.
Phase 3 (Logic and Oversight): The developer will review the AI-generated UI code and implement the necessary business logic.
Architect's Note: This workflow was adopted after extensive research into modern AI-assisted development pipelines. It is designed to maximize development speed while maintaining high-quality, developer-led oversight. The full research document (AI Web Design To IDE Workflow) is archived for historical context.
VIII. Specific Component Styling Rules
Chat Interface ("iMessage" Pattern):
User's own messages: Right-aligned, Primary Blue background, white text.
Other participants' messages: Left-aligned, gray background, black text.
AI messages: Left-aligned, with a distinct AI avatar/icon and a unique, subtle background color (#F3F4FF).
IX. Post-Launch Strategy (Formalized)
User Feedback & Iteration Framework: Immediately following launch, we will implement a structured process for capturing and acting on user feedback via a three-tab Google Sheet:
Framework: Defines the process for collecting, categorizing, and prioritizing feedback.
Repository: A master list of all incoming feedback from all channels.
Roadmap: A prioritized list of features and fixes to be developed, derived from the repository.
