Disagreement.AI: Business Plan & Strategic Roadmap (v8.2 - Competition Edition)
Document Version: 8.2 Date: October 14, 2025 Status: FINAL. This document is the single source of truth, superseding all previous versions. It reflects our strategic pivot to win the AI.gov Presidential Challenge.

1.0 Executive Summary
Disagreement.AI is a chat-based platform that utilizes a conversational AI to mediate and resolve disputes. Our mission is to provide an impartial, efficient, and accessible alternative to traditional conflict resolution methods.
Our immediate and primary objective is to build a best-in-class product to win the AI.gov Presidential Challenge. This supersedes all previous launch plans. Our strategy is centered on a Tiered Development Framework, designed to build a feature-complete, ethically transparent, and technologically superior platform by the competition deadline of January 13th, 2026.
An MVP will be launched as a milestone along this path to a select group of "Founding Members" for crucial feedback. The platform will be free for all users with unlimited features until February 1st, 2026, at which point a pre-developed, usage-based pricing model will be activated to begin commercialization.

2.0 Vision & Market Opportunity
Vision: To become the world's most trusted platform for AI-driven dispute resolution.
Mission: To democratize conflict resolution by providing a simple, fair, and effective tool that empowers users to find clarity and agreement.
Market Opportunity: The current Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) market is dominated by platforms that merely facilitate human mediation. We are positioned to disrupt this market by automating the core function of resolution itself, creating a new category of "AI-native" resolution. Our initial focus is the untapped market of "micro-disputes"—low-value conflicts common in digital commerce that are currently abandoned due to a lack of viable solutions.
2.1 Alignment with the AI.gov Presidential Challenge
The "Team Harmonizer" vertical directly addresses the White House's stated interest in "promoting healthy peer engagement and a safer digital future" by providing a proactive tool to de-escalate conflict before it damages team cohesion and performance. This strategic alignment positions our project as a direct solution to the challenges outlined by the competition, making our submission both relevant and compelling.

3.0 The Tiered Development Framework
Our development is structured into three sequential tiers, ensuring a direct and focused path to our competition goal.
3.1 Tier 1: The Core Foundation (MVP Candidate)
Objective: To build a stable, secure, and functional platform that delivers the core value proposition. The completion of this tier triggers the MVP launch.
Key Features: Secure User Authentication, Case Management Dashboard, Advanced Invitation & Approval System, Core Chat Interface, Base Conversational AI Mediator, Final Agreement Generation & Export, Dynamic & Personalized Invitation Pages, Accessibility Compliance (WCAG).
3.2 Tier 2: The Competition Winner
Objective: To build the feature set required to win the AI.gov Presidential Challenge.
The "Glass Box" Principle:
AI Decision Log: A user-facing, real-time log that provides a transparent trace of the AI's reasoning.
Plain-Language XAI (Explainable AI): Simple summaries explaining why the AI is making a suggestion.
Agreement Analyzer: Allows the AI to ingest and analyze user-uploaded documents for points of contention and compromise.
The "Context Engine" (Graph + Vector Database): To solve the "Amnesiac AI" problem, our backend will feature a combined Graph and Vector database. This allows our AI to maintain a deep, relational understanding of a dispute's entire history, ensuring it makes more intelligent, context-aware suggestions and strengthening the transparency of the AI Decision Log.
Proof of Concept - The "Team Harmonizer" Vertical: A specialized B2B model positioned as a "preventative care" layer for workplace friction, demonstrating our platform's value in complex, multi-participant dynamics. For the competition, our primary proof-of-concept and go-to-market focus will be the sports vertical, specifically targeting the dynamics of South Carolina high school and elite travel basketball teams (Nike, Adidas, & Under Armour).
3.3 Tier 3: The Commercial Engine (Post-Competition Scale)
Objective: To build features required for broad market adoption and long-term commercial success.
Key Features: Full Suite of Vertical-Specific AI Models, AI-Powered Debate Platform, Enterprise Suite (API & Integrations), Full Geographic & Language Support, Resolution Verification & Payment Integration, Premium Community Forum, Voice-to-Text Chat Input.
Tiered Integration Strategy: To achieve market penetration and embed our service into existing workflows, we will execute a three-tiered integration strategy:
Tier 1 (Competition Showcase): A non-production Proof-of-Concept (POC) integration with Slack will be developed specifically for the competition submission video. This will provide a powerful visual demonstration of our "in-workflow" resolution capabilities.
Tier 2 (Post-Competition Quick Wins - Q1 2026): Immediately following the competition, we will launch full-featured applications in high-volume public marketplaces, starting with the Slack App Directory and the Shopify App Store.
Tier 3 (Strategic Partnerships - 2026 & Beyond): We will pursue deeper, API-driven partnerships with enterprise platforms, including Microsoft Teams, major freelance marketplaces like Upwork, and leading HR/Project Management software providers.
Real-Time Collaboration Layer (CRDTs): To provide a premium, Google Docs-like user experience, we will integrate a CRDT-based service (e.g., Liveblocks) when building our "Final Agreement Generation" feature. This will power features like real-time collaborative agreement editing, elevating the platform from a simple chat tool to a professional-grade collaborative workspace.

4.0 Go-to-Market & Branding
Brand Voice: Calm, Confident, Neutral.
Core Messaging: Emphasize providing users with leverage, speed, and fairness.
Official Brand Identity:
Logo: "Disagreement.AI" in Inter Extra Bold. The word "agreement" is styled in Primary Blue.
Primary Blue: #2667FF.

5.0 Governance & Ethical Commitments
Data Deletion Policy: All sensitive user data related to a dispute will be permanently and automatically deleted 120 days after case resolution.
Ethical AI Training: Our AI models will not be trained on scraped or copyrighted data, mitigating the "ROSS Risk." Model improvements will be based on a transparent, opt-in "Data for Value" exchange.
Post-Launch Priority: Immediately following the MVP launch, we will activate a structured framework for capturing and acting on feedback from our "Founding Members" to accelerate our progress toward the competition-winning product.
