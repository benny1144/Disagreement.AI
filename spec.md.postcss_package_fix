# Specification: PostCSS Package & Configuration Fix
- **ID:** `spec.md.postcss_package_fix`
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Date:** October 10, 2025
- **Author:** Gemini, Project Architect

## 1.0 Document Purpose
This document specifies the final required change to the project's styling pipeline. It addresses a build failure caused by a version update in the core Tailwind CSS library.

## 2.0 Problem Analysis
- **Symptom:** The build fails with a PostCSS error.
- **Root Cause:** The installed version of Tailwind CSS requires its PostCSS plugin to be installed as a separate package (`@tailwindcss/postcss`). The current `postcss.config.js` is attempting to use the old, direct `tailwindcss` plugin, which no longer exists in that form.

## 3.0 Technical Requirements
1.  **Install New Dependency:** The `@tailwindcss/postcss` package must be added to the project's development dependencies.
2.  **Update Configuration:** The `postcss.config.js` file must be updated to reference this new package.

## 4.0 Verification Criteria
- After this change is committed and pushed, the deployment on Render must build and deploy successfully.
- The application's styling must be fully functional on the live site.
