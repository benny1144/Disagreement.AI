Disagreement.AI: Tier 1 Implementation Blueprint (v1.0)


I. Purpose & Scope

This document provides the detailed technical specifications and product requirements for the features defined in Tier 1 of the Business Plan (v8.0). It is the single source of truth for the development team and the AI Implementer (Junie) for building the Core Foundation of the Disagreement.AI platform.
Its purpose is to guide the execution of the initial product version, which will be launched to a select group of "Founding Members" for feedback.
Project Vision: A chat-based resolution platform where a conversational AI facilitates and mediates disputes1.


Guiding Principles: Simplicity, User Trust, Performance, and Scalability2.



II. Required Pages & User Experience (Tier 1)


Public-Facing Pages 3

Homepage: A clean landing page with a 90-second animated explainer video, a clear value proposition, and a prominent sign-up call-to-action4.


Legal: Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions, and a Contact Us page5.


Support: A comprehensive FAQ page6.



Application Pages 7

Authentication: Standard Register and Login pages8.


Onboarding: A simple, one-time flow explaining the 3-step resolution process: State Your Case, AI Analyzes, Reach Agreement9.


Dashboard: The user's home base, using a "Bento Grid" layout to organize cases. It must feature a well-designed empty state10.


Chat Page: The core product interface, designed with a "de-escalation by design" principle. It must include a persistent legal disclaimer: "Please note: The AI does not provide legally binding advice."11.


User Account: Standard Profile and Settings pages12.



III. Core Tier 1 Features

User Authentication: Secure email/password registration and login13.


Invitation System ("Creator Approval Gate"): A system for adding participants to a dispute that requires the original creator's approval before they can join14.


Two-Party Chat: A real-time chat interface for two participants and the AI mediator15.


Base AI Mediator Agent: The core conversational AI, built with CrewAI, that guides the resolution process16.


Architect's Note: This refers to the base conversational agent. Advanced features like the "Glass Box" audit trail and document analysis are part of the Tier 2 build.
Final Agreement & Case Closure: A feature allowing users to formally agree on a resolution, which archives the case17.


Email Notifications: Automated email workflows, managed by n8n, for all critical user actions (registration, invitations, approvals, etc.)18.



IV. Technology Stack & Architecture

Frontend: React / Next.js19.


Backend: Node.js (Express.js)20.


Database: MongoDB21.


AI Service: Python (FastAPI) & CrewAI22.


Workflow Automation: n8n23.


Deployment: Render24.


Architectural Model: The platform will use a microservices model where the main Node.js API communicates with a specialized Python AI Service25. The backend stack was chosen to align with the existing codebase and ensure a timely Tier 1 launch26.



V. Data, Privacy & Brand Identity

Data Deletion Mandate: All sensitive dispute data is to be permanently deleted from the database 120 days after case resolution27.


AI Training Protocol (Tier 1): The initial AI model will be trained exclusively on synthetic data. No user data will be used for training to ensure maximum privacy and trust from day one28.


Official Logo: "Disagreement.AI" in Inter Extra Bold. The word "agreement" must be in the Primary Blue color, while "Dis" and ".AI" are the standard text color29.


Primary Color: #2667FF30.



VI. Development Workflow & Styling


Official Design & Implementation Workflow 31

This project will follow a strict, developer-led "Visual Reference & Agent Workflow" to maximize speed and quality32323232.

Phase 1 (Ideation): Layouts are generated with Relume, and static mockups are created in Uizard. The deliverable is a single PNG image33.


Phase 2 (AI-Powered Implementation): The JetBrains AI Implementer builds the React component by referencing the feature's spec and the PNG mockup34.


Phase 3 (Logic and Oversight): The developer reviews the AI-generated UI code and implements the necessary business logic35.



Specific Component Styling Rules 36

Chat Interface ("iMessage" Pattern): 37


User's messages: Right-aligned, Primary Blue background, white text38.


Opponent's messages: Left-aligned, gray background, black text39.


AI messages: Left-aligned, with a distinct AI icon and a subtle background color (#F3F4FF)40.



VII. Post-Launch Feedback Framework (Tier 1)

Immediately following the Tier 1 launch, a structured process for capturing and acting on feedback from our "Founding Members" will be activated41. This process will be managed via a three-tab Google Sheet:

Framework: Defines the process for collecting, categorizing, and prioritizing all feedback42.


Repository: A master list of all incoming feedback from all channels43.


Roadmap: A prioritized list of features and fixes to be developed, which will inform the final push toward the Tier 2 competition goal44.
